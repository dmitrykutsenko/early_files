This kind of light Single-Page-Application was created to try some different features
learned during my front-end courses studies all together (without any specification).

The idea is that two sortable & draggable lists can help user, faced again to new
question such as "to be or not to be", to understand what way to choose through
collecting all pros&cons regarding this issue.


It consists of: JS + jQuery + jQuery UI + Bootstrap + _lodash + Materialize
(and HTML 4 + CSS 2 of course)
